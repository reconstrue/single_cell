Currently this is very much not the case for R as we will see shortly; the installs are slow and annoying, c'est la vie but another detail that makes R on Colab nowhere near as cool as Python on Colab. This is a real drag given the frequent disconnects upon idle, as well as the hard 12 hour limit imposed on Colab.\n"
