# Example dataset analysis

This directory contains notebooks which demonstrate the application of
this repo's tools to example datasets. These code recipes demonstate
loading the data into a Colab VM's file system and then processing them
in a Jupyter notebook with the Python code in this repo.

The following are representitive of various dataset sizes:
- ~75K cells: Allen Institute's Mouse brain cell type diversity dataset
- 1.3M cells: Fred Hutch MOCA dataset
